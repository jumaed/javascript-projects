# Practice JavaScript Projects

Here are some of my practice JavaScript projects built with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.


## [Javascript Weather App](https://jumaed-js-weather-app.netlify.app)
This weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Dhaka, BD).
